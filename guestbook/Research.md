Research Summaries

What is a Cloudflare Worker?A Cloudflare Worker is a serverless function running on Cloudflare's edge network, allowing developers to execute JavaScript or TypeScript code close to users for low-latency request processing. It eliminates server management and supports dynamic web application logic.

How does a Worker handle HTTP requests and return responses?A Worker intercepts HTTP requests using event listeners, processes them with JavaScript (e.g., parsing URLs or bodies), and returns Responses with custom content or headers via the Fetch API. It operates asynchronously at the edge for fast delivery.

What is Cloudflare D1? What are some pros and cons of using it?Cloudflare D1 is a serverless SQLite-based database on Cloudflare's edge for low-latency data storage and querying. Pros include seamless Worker integration and global access; cons include limited query complexity and smaller storage compared to traditional databases.

How does client-side JavaScript call an external API?Client-side JavaScript uses the Fetch API to send HTTP requests (e.g., GET or POST) to an API endpoint, handling JSON responses asynchronously. CORS must be configured to allow cross-origin requests from the browser.

What is the benefit of deploying APIs to the edge instead of traditional servers?Edge-deployed APIs reduce latency by processing requests near users, scale automatically with serverless architecture, and lower costs by eliminating server maintenance. They also leverage global caching for improved performance.
